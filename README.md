# Testing ADD_NUMBER project

ADD_NUMBER is a program that, given an integer N, returns the maximum possible value obtained by inserting one n digit inside the decimal representation of integer N.

EXAMPLES:
n = 5
Given N = 0, the program should return 50
Given N = 9819, the program should return 98519
Given N = -9819, the program should return -59819

All the functions are tested using test_add_number.py.
With requirements.txt and tests.yml (inside subdirectory workflows insided .github directory) each time I make a push on the repository an automated test will run.
